This document contains descriptions of the code and tasks used in to create the Final Demo.
Note that the final code used for the demo is called Final_Code.ino, which is in the Simulation and Control folder.

Localization
--
For this demo, the main localization focus was to determine how to make the ninety degree turn. After demo 2,
the robot could make it through the course until the sharper turns. The first step was to increase the angle of
the camera so that it would be less likely to miss a turn. This made it so that it moved less distance each time 
it processed the camera image updating. This made it so that it could make one of the sharper turns without losing sight
of the tape. The next step was to make it so that the robot would turn when it lost sight of the tape (at the 90 degree
turn), which is further discussed in simulation and control.
