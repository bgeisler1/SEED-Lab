Using the first order equation of the system, we may derive the formulae as follows:

Operating At deltaV = 1V
K = 0.242169811320755
0.64K = 0.1550
Closest Coordinates:
(0.06, 0.15)
(0.08, 0.19)

Linear Interpolation Result:
(0.0625, 0.155)

σ = 1/0.0625 = 16
Transfer Fcn = 16*0.242169811320755/(s+16)

The image of the step experiment for the translational velocity where the sigmaV is 1V is shown below:

Operating At SigmaV = 1V
K = 0.07
0.64K = 0.0448

Closest Coordinates:
(0.08, 0.04)
(0.10, 0.06)

Linear Interpolation Result:
(0.0848, 0.448)

σ = 1/.0848 = 11.79245283

Transfer Fcn = 0.8254716/(s + 11.79245283)
